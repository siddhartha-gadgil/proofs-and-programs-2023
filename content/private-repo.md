#### Repository for lab assignments

The lab assignments are to be _submitted_ by making a __private__ copy of the course repository. To do this create an empty _private_ repository and then follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository). Once this is done add me (_siddhartha-gadgil_ on Github) as a collaborator to your repository.

You will need to keep the repository updated from the course repository.
To do this you need to [configure this as upstream](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/configuring-a-remote-repository-for-a-fork) and periodically [sync](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).
